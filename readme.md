# Period tracker algorithm challenge
Hi! This app is created for a Tjejer kodar event hosted by Natural Cycles.
Your challenge is to write an algorithm that will predict when your next period will start.

Do this by using the data that gets presented to you by the app.


## Get started
- Open `index.html` in your browser
- Open the whole folder in your favourite editor
- You will find your challenge in `algorithm.js`
